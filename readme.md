Project 2- Build a Giphy search engine- for this project, the goal was to build a simple search using API calls to the giphy database, based on user input.
My site is pretty simple- it uses bootstrap button functionality and a search form to make requests to the Giphy API, which returns an area of JSON data, which is then parsed and generated in the body of the page as gif. images. I included the main search function, as well as a random button, which calls giphy's "random" endpoint. It also has a "translate" button, which uses their own algorithm to match a specific gif or gifs to a search term.
Technologies used- HTML, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap
I am mostly happy with the work I've done, although I would've liked to include some functionality with pagination of the data and page numbers to navigate between. If I was to continue working on this project, I would add that functionality in.
